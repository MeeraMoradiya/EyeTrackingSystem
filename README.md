# EyeTrackingSystem

**Virtual Keyboard operated by eye gaze**<br>
This is a school project implementd just for purpose of learning basics of Python for computer vision, Numpy and OpenCV libraries. The code may be duplicated as I have tried different approaches to implement same functionality

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/MeeraMoradiya/EyeTrackingSystem.git

## Requirements
Python 3.6 or 3.7<br>
dlib<br>
opencv<br>
numpy<br>
winsound<br>

## Description

Execute below command to run the application<br>

The selected letter will be written in the notepad if user blinks for 9 frames (user will be notified to open eyes using sound ) Using * key the written text can be converted to speech

<br>eye_detection.py</br>
This file is just to detect eye to learn basics of eye detection

<br>eye_motion_tracking.py</br>
To learn how to convert image into grey scale image using threshold by using opencv functions
